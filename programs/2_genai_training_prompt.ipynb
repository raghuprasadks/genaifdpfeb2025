            "\n",

However, this might lead to memory waste if you perform frequent modifications to your string.\n",

            "2) StringBuilder: Unlike String, it is mutable in nature. This means we can change the object's content. It offers append(), insert(), delete(), and other methods to manipulate the string, making it a suitable choice when dealing with strings that need to be modified frequently, for example when reading in chunks of a file or building a dynamic SQL query. It is not thread-safe which limits its performance overhead caused by the synchronization.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) StringBuffer: It also is a mutable class, similar to StringBuilder. But the core difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe - the methods are synchronized, meaning only one thread can access the method at a time. This is very useful in a multi-threading environment but this also makes it less efficient than StringBuilder when working with single threaded scenarios due to synchronization overhead.\n",
